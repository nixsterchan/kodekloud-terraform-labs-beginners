Just a simple repository for storing some of the templates used in the terraform kodekloud exercises alongside some notes.

Exercises that stood out for me:
1. AWS DynamoDB uploading
2. AWS S3 uploading
3. AWS EC2 and Provisioners handling
4. Terraform remote state
5. Terraform functions and conditional expressions
6. Terraform workspaces and modules

Extras:
1. Additional tests on the terraform state remote backend
